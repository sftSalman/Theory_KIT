What is the meaning of axis=-1 in keras.argmax?

This means that the index that will be returned by argmax will be taken from the last axis.

Your data has some shape (19,19,5,80). This means:

Axis 0 = 19 elements
Axis 1 = 19 elements
Axis 2 = 5 elements
Axis 3 = 80 elements
Now, negative numbers work exactly like in python lists, in numpy arrays, etc. Negative numbers represent the inverse order:

Axis -1 = 80 elements
Axis -2 = 5 elements
Axis -3 = 19 elements
Axis -4 = 19 elements
When you pass the axis parameter to the argmax function, the indices returned will be based on this axis. Your results will lose this specific axes, but keep the others.

See what shape argmax will return for each index:

K.argmax(a,axis= 0 or -4) returns (19,5,80) with values from 0 to 18
K.argmax(a,axis= 1 or -3) returns (19,5,80) with values from 0 to 18
K.argmax(a,axis= 2 or -2) returns (19,19,80) with values from 0 to 4
K.argmax(a,axis= 3 or -1) returns (19,19,5) with values from 0 to 79
